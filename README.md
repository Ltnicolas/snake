Snake for x86!

Originally a project for Digital Systems Architecture, a 3rd year subject in the Electronic Engineering career, year 2013.


NOTE: 
Requires DOSBOX (or any MS-DOS emulator) to run. It will not work on modern consoles since it was made for a different architecture

CONTENTS: 
Executable and source code in case it's of your interest :)



HOW TO RUN:

1) Download DOSBox
2) Drop the game's contents on, say, c:/asdfg
3) open DOSBox and mount said folder as, again say, X drive; by typing in DOSBox "mount X c:/asdfg"
4) Navigate to mounted folder by typing "X:"
4) Run the game by simply typing "snake"


HOW TO PLAY:

1) Right at the start, define keys for Up, Down, Left and Right movement (text is in Spanish)
2) if game over, press any key to exit back to DOS, you can type "snake" again to re-play



GAME MECHANICS:
- Each fruit eaten is 10 points.
- At 100 points you will advance to level 2, screen will reset and obstacles will appear, you will be granted a bonus of 10 points
- At 200 points you will advance to level 3, screen will reset again and an additional set of obstacles will appear, you will be granted a bonus of 50 points
- Careful with the movement mechanics! Some prediction is needed. This was a design flaw which although not intentional adds an interesting flavor to gameplay.
- The above leads to a secret technique with which you can move faster, in case you're the impatient type :)



CREDITS:
I wasn't alone in this project. Co-designed by Joel Nader, my project partner, a classmate for years and an example of hard work. Gracias por todo, capo.




TRIVIA:

- Screen Resolution is a whopping, staggering, mind-boggling 320x200px, 256 colors
- coded in Notepad++ - There was simply no IDE for Assembly at the time the project was made, and it's not at all expected to be made anymore (retro...)
- compiled with NASM (Netwide Assembler).
- We got a 35/40 score on the assignment. Not bad!
- Never forget where you came from. Retro FTW!
